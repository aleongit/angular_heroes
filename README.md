## Introduction

https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes

This Tour of Heroes tutorial provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular and shows you how to:
- Set up your local Angular development environment.
- Use the Angular CLI to develop an application.

The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features that you'd expect to find in any data-driven application.

The finished application:
- Gets a list of heroes
- Displays the heroes in a list
- Edits a selected hero's details
- Navigates between different views of heroic data

This tutorial helps you gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do by showing you how to:

- Use Angular **directives** to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular **components** to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way **data binding** for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with **pipes**.
- Create a shared **service** to assemble the heroes.
- Use **routing** to navigate among different views and their components.
